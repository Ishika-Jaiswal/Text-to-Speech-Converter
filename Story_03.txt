The greek god Adonis

Adonis was a handsome mortal with whom the Greek goddess Aphrodite fell in love. Adonis took many lovers, and was closely associated with love, beauty, and lust. After his transition from mortal to god, Adonis was celebrated for his connection to death and rebirth.

The mortal Adonis died one day while out on a hunt. Aphrodite, distraught by his death, coerced Zeus to bring him back to life.

Through his rebirth, Adonis is related to the four seasons of the Earth. The fall and winter represent the death of Adonis, a depressing time for Aphrodite and the other gods. Zeus's resurrection of Adonis, meanwhile, represents spring, summer, and the rebirth of the vegetation.

Adonis is said to be the god of:

Vegetation
Beauty
Youth
The seasons
Rebirth
Fertility
